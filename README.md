Gamcl√©e is a canvas-based javascript game framework, inspired by Gamvas (http://www.93i.de/products/software/gamvas)

It has been revamped to use require.js for including/optimizing components, and cleaned up to make maintenance easier (and so it passes JSLint.)

An incredible amount of credit goes to Heiko Irrgang, of 93-interactive for laying most of the groundwork for a fun and flexible, beginner-friendly framework.
